"""Build a machine program.

The project is based on the example I showed you on class, the ATM, use it only 
as a reference for your project. Look around you, there are many examples of
automatic machines such as vending machines, software that sells ticket for movies,
etc.

Requirements:
Build an app, that is not an ATM, with at least the complexity of the class exercise.
It MUST handle different issues or options. Review every possible option 
available.

MUST include a dictionary, if-else statements, loops, string methods and user input.
Must include docstrings and comments.
No code outiside of the functions, entry point must be clear.
Please, handle multiple scenenarios in the case the user type something else than what you expect.
Break the issues in small functions, make your code readable.

Important notes:
Althougt ideas can be similar, this is NOT a team project, duplicated or copied 
code is not accepted, every student has to do their own app.
Check the code, projects that do not run properly will fail.

Demo:
Record a screen capture video, no longer than 3 mins. In the video, explain your code and then execute it. 
The video should be uploaded to a cloud services like OneDrive, it is up to you. Make sure I have access to it. 
Include the link in the docstring of the main entry point in the specified area. You can use Camtasia, OBS, 
or any other recording system.
